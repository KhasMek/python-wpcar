# Wireless Packet Capture Auditing and Reporting

Beta release - This has proven stable for me, but use at your own risk.

Completed documentation coming soon.

**TODO:**

- [ ] Add check for length of the SSID and extend the height of the cell if needed.
- [ ] Merge in Elasticsearch functions.
- [ ] Assessts dir.
- [ ] Refactor the workbook formatting into it's own function (maybe).
- [ ] Function to write config file to local directory.
- [ ] Less garbage name.
